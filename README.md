# Machine Learning to Real Life Problem Using WEKA and MATLAB

In the modern environment, technology advances at a breakneck pace, and we are constantly expose new innovations.
Artificial Intelligence is one of the burgeoning computer science technologies that is poised to usher in a new era in the world by creating intelligent machines. The term artificialtifical Intelligence is described as a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and be able to make decisions. The project focuses on the use of subfields of AI such as machine learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation, optimization
and game theory to solver real life problems. The project is divided into three parts;
* PART 1: is mainly about machine learning using WEKA. Datasets are provided for this
end
* PART 2: involves the use of MATLAB and other software if necessary, to solve real-life
optimization case studies.
* PART 3: is concerned with interesting practical applications of machine learning knowlsoftware
# Required softwares to access this project files
* WEKA for data mining and machine learning
* MATLAB for optimization problems 
# Insights on each part of the project
* PART 1 :
This part entails the use of the WEKA software to analyse, classify and draw conclusions using a selected dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It involves the use of classification algorithms such as the Naive Bayes, decision trees, Logistic regressio,n etc to perform data mining tasks and draw analysis on a dataset.
* PART 2:
This part is about optimization using matlab.The concept of optimization is basically what we do in our daily lives that is a desire to do better or be the best in one field or another. In engineering we wish to produce the best possible result with the available resources.The optimization problems are taken from F. S. Hillier and G. J. Lieberman, Introduction to Operations Research, 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001. Specifically CASE 17.1 REDUCING IN-PROCESS INVENTORY. 2001. WE extracted the variables, the objective function
and the constraints from the problem given and the MATLAB optimization toolbox and the genetic and simulated annealing
algorithms were used to solve these problems.
* PART 3:
This part entails the use of machine learning algorithm to solve pratcical problem precisely a heart disease prediction web aplication that can predict the heart condition using data inputs. To run part three you need to have python 3 or newer version, anaconda and a text editor other libraries dependencies are flask, numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and scikit learn. Follow these steps and you good to go;
To run the application
1. Replace the url in the app.py file and the Heart Disease Prediction file to the url of your csv file location.
2. Run both files
3. Run anaconda and create a virtual environment.
4. This environment should have these libraries(Flask, numpy, pandas, scikit learn,matplotlib,seaborn)
5. Run the anaconda command prompt
6. Activate your virtual environment using (conda activate 'name of your environment created'+ ENTER) 
7.Run the folder with the files(cd "url of the folder location"+ENTER)
8.Type flask run + ENTER
9.After running a url is displayed e.g."http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
10. Copy and paste url in your preferred browser.
